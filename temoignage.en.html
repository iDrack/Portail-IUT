                        After having passed his A-levels, Damien Lefebvre spent a few months on the university benches, before reorienting, in search of a more supervised training. As his university experience revealed him a taste for computer science, he decides to apply for a DUT of computing engineering software, at the IUT of Villetaneuse in 2002.

                        The framing proposed by passionate teachers, the acquiring of rigorous work methods incited him to complete his training via a Professional Licence SIL, proposed by the same Institute.
                        <br>
                        "The knowledge and skills developed by three years studying the algorithmics, databases, but also the countable aspects of the economic world, was the key that allowed me to be recruited by a grand French IT services company, after four months of training."

                        For a year and a half the young analyst programmer has offered his skills into service of big clients,(among them famous bank establishments) and he's now willing to direct his future toward consulting.

                            Amaury chose the DUT because he thinks it was a training adapted for people willing to learns more in a specific field, thus letting the students to specialize themselve in a field like computer science and the school subjets around it like communication, plus being a continuous monitoring training had a big role in Amaury choice.
                            <br><br>
                            "I think the DUT is welcoming, well guided, with homogene work groups and a good mentality, it's a training that, when we are interrested, is really good especialy with the <abbr title="Lectures">CM</abbr>, <abbr title="Diricted Works">TD</abbr>, <abbr title="Practical Work">TP</abbr> that are well oriented and with them, it's never boring to go to school."

								Zack Blondel have his A-levels with computing science specialisation. He decide to apply for the IUT of Lens to pursue his studies in the computer science sector.   
								<br>
								<br>
								Zack choosed a DUT because this diploma allows to study while still being supervized by a teacher. 
								Moreover, the computer science DUT allows an offer for international mobility, in other words to do interships and/or continue studies in foreign universities.
								And finaly because this diploma leads to a lot of opportunities in companies.
								<br>
								<br>
								« I believe there are a lot of lessons linked with computing science, but also with lessons to help with his future, and that's a real pro. »
								<br>
								<br>
								At the end of the DUT, Zack wants to continue his studies in an alternating training in computer science.
